This repo contains code to implement an empirical verification of Zipf's law using a parallel multilingual corpus about EU legalisations in six different languages; German,
French, Greek, Bulgarian, Finnish, and Maltese.  


To run the code 

`python zipfs_law.py`


The program will produce the following plots
